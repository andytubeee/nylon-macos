# Nylon Mac App

A menu bar app that lists the nodes in your [nylon](https://github.com/encodeous/nylon) network.

## Install

For Apple Silicon Macs on macOS 14 or later.

1. Open `Nylon.dmg` and drag Nylon onto Applications.
2. Open Nylon. macOS blocks it the first time, because the app isn't notarized by Apple. Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security, find "Nylon was blocked", and click Open Anyway. Or skip the dialog:

   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Nylon.app
   ```

3. Click the nylon icon in the menu bar, then "Choose central.yaml…" and pick your file.

To build the DMG yourself, run `Packaging/package.sh`. It writes `dist/Nylon.dmg`.

## Run it from source

1. Install the Command Line Tools if you don't have them: `xcode-select --install`
2. From this folder, build and start it:

   ```bash
   swift build -c release && .build/release/NylonApp
   ```

3. Click the nylon icon in the menu bar, then "Choose central.yaml…" and pick your file. The app remembers it for next time.

4. For latency, turn on nylon's metrics endpoint. Add this to `node.yaml` and restart nylon:

   ```yaml
   observability_addr: 127.0.0.1:9090
   ```

   Without it the menu says "Not running". The app doesn't need root.

To skip the picker, pass the file: `.build/release/NylonApp -central /path/to/central.yaml`. With no file chosen, it reads `central.yaml` in the current directory, like `nylon run`. If nylon serves metrics somewhere else, pass `-metrics http://127.0.0.1:<port>/metrics`.

## Try it without nylon

`.dev/` has a fake network and a fake nylon `/metrics` that returns new latencies on every request. From this folder, in two terminals:

```bash
python3 .dev/fake-metrics.py
```

```bash
.dev/run.sh .dev/central.yaml -metrics http://127.0.0.1:9091/metrics
```

## Test

```bash
swift test -Xswiftc -plugin-path -Xswiftc "$(xcode-select -p)/usr/lib/swift/host/plugins/testing"
```

The `-plugin-path` flag is only needed without full Xcode.
